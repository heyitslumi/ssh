#!/bin/bash

# Lumi's SSH key manager
#
# This script is used as a way to help users as fast as possible by instead of sharing their server's password, they add my SSH key, and I have access to their server.
# Idea inspired by Virtfusion
# This is the old version of the script, which is no longer maintained, accessible via:
#   $ wget -qO- https://ssh.amogus.works/old.sh | bash
#
# We recommend using the new version of the script, accessible via:
#   $ wget -qO- https://ssh.amogus.works/script.sh | bash
# 
# Have fun! Made with ❤️ by Lumi
