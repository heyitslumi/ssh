# amogus's SSH key manager
#
# This script is used as a way to help users as fast as possible by instead of sharing their server's password, they add my SSH key, and I have access to their server.
# Idea inspired by Virtfusion, GPT-4o helped with this lol
# This is the new version of the script, accessible via:
#   $ wget -qO- https://ssh.amogus.works/script.sh | bash
#
# We also have a legacy version of the script, which is no longer maintained, accessible via:
#   $ wget -qO- https://ssh.amogus.works/old.sh | bash
# 
# Have fun! Made with ❤️ by amogus

● What you can do next:
  ○ Share your server's IP Address:
    If you need support and I asked you to run this script, please share your server's IP address, as well as your SSH port.
    ○ Please, do not share your server's password, as I will not use it. If you are still using passwords, I recommend migrating to SSH Keys. It's safer.
  ○ Remove the SSH key:

  ○ Check key status:
    Use \`wget -qO- https://ssh.amogus.works/script.sh | bash -s -- check\` to confirm if the key is installed.
